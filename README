This package contains analysis code for the R&D TPCs being built at
UCLA by Alden Fan and Yixiong Meng. Executables are generated with
the Makefile simply via 'make'. As of 2014-01-21, there are two
executables: tpcanalysis and eventviewer. 

I will continue adding details to this README file as the code develops.
