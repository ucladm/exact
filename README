This package contains analysis code for the R&D TPCs being built at
UCLA by Alden Fan and Yixiong Meng. Executables are generated with
the Makefile simply via 'make'. As of 2014-01-21, there are two
executables: tpcanalysis and eventviewer. 

I will continue adding details to this README file as the code develops.

Instructions for getting set up to edit and run the UCLA-DM TPC analysis 
code.

0. Make sure git is available on your machine. PS: It's REALLY easy to 
install on a Mac.

1. If you don't have one already, make an account at github.com. Don't 
worry about actually making a github repository. You just need the 
account to be able to push to the official repository, which is hosted 
on github. 

2. Once you have an account, let me (Alden) know your username and I'll 
add you as a collaborator. 

3. On the machine where you will be working, set a couple git config 
parameters:
	git config --global user.name "Your Name"
	git config --global user.email username@email.com
NOTE: the email MUST be the same one that you used in step 1. As far as 
github is concerned, your email is your identity. 

4. Checkout the repository. This will create a directory called "exact". 
Make sure there isn't already something by that name in the directory 
where you invoke this step:
	git clone https://github.com/ucladm/exact.git


All set!
